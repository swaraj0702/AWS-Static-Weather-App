# AWS-Static-Weather-App
This project focuses on the secure deployment of a static, responsive Weather Application on AWS Cloud using Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront. The application fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API and presents it through a clean, user-friendly interface. The primary objective of the project was not just to build a weather app.
